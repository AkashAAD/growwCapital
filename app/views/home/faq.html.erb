        </h4>
        <div id="wirrrltrr" class="collapse">
          <p>The Repo rate is the interest rate RBI charges on money borrowed by commercial banks. Repo rate helps RBI in controlling inflation.</p>
          <p>The reverse repo rate is the interest rate on which RBI borrows money from banks. The reverse repo rate helps the RBI control the supply of money.</p>
          <p>The reverse repo rate will always be lower than the repo rate because RBI cannot pay higher interest on deposits than charging interest on loans.</p>
          <p>The Repo rate is higher than the reverse repo rate because it helps RBI with proper cash flow to banks. A rise in repo rate directly banks as they increase the interest rate which makes borrowing costlier. An increase in the repo rate makes the savings more attractive.</p>
          <p>The current repo rate of RBI is 4.90%.</p>
          <p>During high inflation in the economy, the RBI increases the reverse repo. It encourages the banks to lend more funds to the RBI to earn higher returns on excess funds.</p>
          <p>The current reverse repo rate of RBI is 3.35%.</p>

        <div id="iihccaistctathe" class="collapse">
          <p>If a credit card is closed after clearing the credit bill, it will still affect the credit score. A credit score is made by proper repayments by the credit card holder. And payments that are made on time develop a good repayment history which boosts your credit score.</p>
          <p>Once you close your credit card, all the payment history and the credits earned till date will be lost. And the credit score will fall.</p>
          <p>Let us look at it this way if you have two credit cards and the credit use on each card is 1 lakh combined, which makes it 2 lakh and you bought an AC for Rs. 50,000, so you used 25% of the total limit. But when you close one card the overall use falls on the other card, which is 50% of the card utilized which makes it unhealthy and credit score is affected negatively.</p>
          <p>What you can do is keep the card with yourself without using it, so the credit points and payment history will play a key role in boosting CIBIL.</p>

          <p>It is best to pay back the amount in full to avoid the interest on the balance.</p>

          <p>The key differences between a credit card and a debit card are:</p>
          <p>A credit card allows a person to spend money by borrowing it from the bank up to a limit.</p>
          <p>A debit card allows you to spend money that is deposited in the bank account.</p>
          <p>A credit card can help you build your CIBIL score when paid the credit bill on time. A debit card use does not affect a CIBIL score.</p>
          <p>The spending limit on a credit card is high, which can lead to bad debt. The spending limit on a debit card is fixed, meaning you can only spend the money deposited in your bank account.</p>

          <p>A credit card limit is the usage limit on the credit card. For example, a person having a credit card can spend up to Rs. 1,00,000 to buy any item of his choice but not more than this sum.</p>
          <p>There are several ways to increase a credit card limit like;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Boost your CIBIL score.</li>
            <li>Repay your bills on time.</li>
            <li>Request to the lender.</li>

          <p>The home loan EMI calculator will help you gain knowledge of how much monthly installment you have to pay for the home loan.</p>

          <p>N = Number of Monthly Installments</p>
          <p>Let us learn from an example, a man who took a loan of 20 lakh for 20 years to build a house. The total amount which he has paid for 20 years will be around 40 lakh.</p>
