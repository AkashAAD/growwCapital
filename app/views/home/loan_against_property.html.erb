      <p class="pl-ser">How can you use Loan against Property (LAP)</p>
      <p>Anyone can apply for loan against property by pledging their residential or commercial property to meet their personal or business needs. You may apply for this loan and use the money to buy new property, funds to expand your business or build infrastructure, debt consolidation to lower cash outflows, holiday, marriage, education etc.  You can avail up to 60% to 70% of the value of property as loan against property.</p>
      <p>Before taking your case to the bank we’ll assess and improve the chances of your getting the loan by evaluating your financial position and value of property.</p>
      <p>We will ensure that properties you are planning to get loan against are free without any mortgage on them.</p>
      <p>If you have multiple properties that you can get loan against, we will help you decide the best and safest option. Besides residential and commercial properties some banks also grant loan against nursing homes with 30 beds, warehouse etc. this info also our Relationship Manger will share with you.</p>
      <p>We will also present list of banks that offer up to 90% of Loan against property as an overdraft.</p>
      <p>If your premise that you want to get loan against is rented out, you should share the fact with our Relationship Employee for him to accordingly proceed with documentation for application.</p>
      <p>Our Relationship Manager will also share possibility of loan transfer to another bank, if you want to take only part disbursement of loan against property, our RM can help to facilitate it. <b>Please note</b> that third party property cannot be offered as LAP, i.e. you cannot apply for loan against your friend’s residence to start your business. Please also note that if more than one person owns the property against which loan has to be taken then all the property owners should be co-applicants of loan. If for some reason in the middle of loan repayment you want to sell the property, you can do it provided you repay entire loan amount on this property.</p>
      <p>Our Relationship Manager will share many such practical facts with you once you get in touch with us with your exact requirement.</p>
