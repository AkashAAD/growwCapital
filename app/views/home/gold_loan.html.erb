      <p>Getting a Gold Loan is simple. Anyone having gold lying in the locker as jewelry can use it by pledging it in the bank or Non-Banking Financial Institution to get loan against it. Gold Loan is a practical way to arrange funds without touching or breaking your long-term investments. Since price of gold is shooting up with each passing phase, borrower can expect to get good value against gold.</p>
      <p class="pl-ser">Eligibility to Apply For Gold Loan</p>
      <p>You can be a farmer, trader, salaried employee or an entrepreneur between the age of 21 and 70 years to apply for gold loan. KYC is all that you are required to submit in terms of documents.</p>
      <p class="pl-ser">Things to keep in mind before applying for gold loan</p>
      <p>How much loan will you get from a bank or NBFC against old depends upon the valuation of gold with you or that that you are ready to pledge. It is important to verify the institution with whom you’re planning to get into loan against gold agreement.</p>
      <p>We help you to communicate and deal with a credible lender.</p>
      <p>You also have to know how to identify the correct lender, meaning between Bank and NBFC what should you choose and why.</p>
      <p>Another important aspect is to pay attention to the available repayment options.</p>
      <p class="pl-ser">How we will help</p>
      <p>Based on your repayment requirements, we shall suggest suitable gold loan options and different offers from banks. We will explain <b>Upfront Interest option</b> that some leading banks offer under which you can pay the entire interest while starting loan and pay principal at the end.</p>
      <p>If you’re a salaried person and would like to go for monthly installment, we will apprise you of <b>Regular EMI option</b> under which you pay back the loan in standard manner, i.e. in equal monthly installments which includes principal and interest.</p>
      <p>Banks also offer <b>Overdraft facility</b> under which convenience of getting an overdraft against gold is granted to borrowers. Under this facility, the borrower is required to pay interest only on the amount that he has utilized.</p>
      <p>We'll assess your requirement and financial position to advise appropriate option.</p>
      <p>Owing to the ongoing pandemic Corona Virus 19, the Reserve Bank of India has increased the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on gold loans from 75% to 90%. This simply means that gold owners can now get more loans against gold. Earlier they used to get 75% of the value of gold pledged by them which has now gone up to 90%.</p>
